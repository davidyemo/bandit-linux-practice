# Bandit Linux Practice

This repository documents my progress through the **OverTheWire Bandit** wargame, focusing on building strong Linux command-line fundamentals.

Bandit is designed to teach core Linux skills through hands-on problem solving. Each level introduces a new concept or reinforces an existing one, requiring practical use of commands rather than theory alone.

This repo serves as a **learning log**, not a solution dump. I record what I did at each stage, the commands or concepts involved, and the key takeaway from the level without exposing passwords or sensitive data.

## What this repository contains

- Level-by-level notes summarising:
  - commands used
  - Linux concepts learned
  - small gotchas or lessons discovered along the way
- Clear, concise explanations written in my own words
- A structured folder layout for easy navigation

## What I’m practicing and reinforcing

- Navigating the Linux filesystem
- Working with files and directories
- Understanding file permissions and ownership
- Using core commands like `ls`, `cat`, `find`, `grep`, and `file`
- Handling edge cases such as hidden files, special filenames, and recursive searches
- Building confidence with the terminal and Bash fundamentals

## Why this repo exists

This repository is part of my broader journey into Linux, Bash scripting, and DevOps fundamentals. Writing things down helps reinforce learning and creates a reference I can revisit later.

It also demonstrates my ability to:
- learn independently
- document technical work clearly
- explain concepts concisely
- build consistent habits around tooling like Git and GitHub

## Notes

- Passwords are intentionally **not included**
- This repository focuses on **learning outcomes**, not walkthroughs
- Content may evolve as I revisit earlier levels with deeper understanding
